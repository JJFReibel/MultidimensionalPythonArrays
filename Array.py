#Multidimensional arrays in Python made easy.
#2D and 3D arrays implemented with functions
#Example use of 2D and 3D arrays (good for 2D and 3D space, or 2D positions at certain times)
#Eample use of 4D array (good for 3D positions at certain times)
#EDIT: Code still has a number of bugs that are being worked on
